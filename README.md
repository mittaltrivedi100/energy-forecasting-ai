#  Energy Consumption Forecasting for Battery-Cell Manufacturing

This project is part of the **Intel AI for Manufacturing Certificate Course** and focuses on optimizing energy usage in battery-cell manufacturing by using machine learning to forecast energy consumption.

---

##  Project Objectives

- Forecast hourly energy consumption based on:
  - Temperature
  - Humidity
  - Production Rate
  - Hour of the day
  - Day of the week
- Help manufacturers reduce energy waste in ovens and chambers
- Provide a user-friendly interface for prediction

---

##  Technologies Used

- **Python 3.8+**
- **scikit-learn**
- **pandas**
- **Streamlit** (for interactive UI)
- **joblib** (for saving/loading the ML model)

---

##  Model Details

- Algorithm: Random Forest Regressor
- Trained on simulated time-series data
- Evaluation Metric: R² Score ≈ 0.88, MAE ≈ 30 units
